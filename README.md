# Coronavirus Tracker and Statistics

## About:
This is an interactive live tracker for the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic, inspired from the COVID-19 Visual Dashboard from Johns Hopkins University (https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). This tracker implements additional statistical models and data that can help people better understand the numbers behind the progression of the pandemic, and hopefully provide additional tools to aid governments and organizations in monitoring the pandemic. Data and graphs are updated daily and sourced from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE): https://systems.jhu.edu/

## Terms of Use:
We made this tracker partially out of boredom of the being stuck at home and partially to make our own difference in combatting this disease. We want these statistical models to be accessible easily by the general public so they can be better prepared for the coming weeks and months and understand the extent of the pandemic. As such, this tracker is to be exclusively used for educational purposes only, and any commercial use is prohibited. Additionally, all rights on the data being used belong solely to Johns Hopkins University, and all terms specified by Johns Hopkins University source repo further apply.
